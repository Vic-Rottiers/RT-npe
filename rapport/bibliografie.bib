  abstract  = {Mathematical  literacy has received increasing attention  in many countries over the  last  few  years.   This  is  partly  driven  by  concerns  of  employers  that  too  many  students  leave  school  unable  to  function  mathematically  at  the  level  needed  in  the  modem  world  of  work.   Further,  it  is  increasingly  recognised  that people can only tackle many  of the challenges of modem  life  effectively  if  they are mathematically  literate in key areas.  Planning in personal  finance,  as-sessment  of  risk,  design  in  the  home  or  on  the  computer  screen,  and  critical  appraisal  of  the  flood  of  statistical  information  from  advertising,  politicians  and the press -  these are just  a few  of the domains  where mathematics is an es-sential  tool  in  sensible  decision  making,  not just  an  exotic  luxury.  Mathemati-cal literacy, like literacy in language, is empowering.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical Literacy is a ‘hot’ topic at present in most countries, whether it is referred to by that name, or in some cases as Numeracy, or Quantitative Literacy, or Matheracy, or as some part of Ethnomathematics, or related to Mathematics in Society. Questions continue to be asked about what is meant by mathematics in any concept of Mathematical Literacy and the use of the very word ‘Literacy’ in its association with Mathematics has been challenged. Its importance, however, lies in changing our perspective on mathematics teaching, away from the elitism so often associated with much mathematics education, and towards a more equitable, accessible and genuinely educational ideal.},
